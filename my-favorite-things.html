    <p>I really love <strong>music</strong>. Music makes me come alive. Every day I dig deep into iTunes and Spotify catalogs
       to check out what's new across various genres. I <em>toy</em> around with various music creation and manipulation
       softwares like Serato DJ, Sony Vegas, FL Studio to name the least.
