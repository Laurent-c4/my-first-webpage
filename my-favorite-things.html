    <p>I really love music. Music makes me come alive. Every day I dig deep into iTunes and Spotify catalogs
       to check out what's new across various genres. I toy around with various music creation and manipulation
       softwares like Serato DJ, Sony Vegas, FL Studio to name the least.
    </p>
